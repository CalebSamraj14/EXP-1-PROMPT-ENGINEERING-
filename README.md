# 📄 Page 1: Introduction to Generative AI  

### 🎯 Aim  
To provide a foundational understanding of **Generative AI**, defining its core purpose and differentiating it from traditional AI.  

### 📖 Content  
Generative AI represents a groundbreaking advancement in artificial intelligence, focusing on **creating novel, original content** rather than merely analyzing or classifying existing data.  

- **Discriminative AI** → Distinguishes categories (e.g., cat vs dog).  
- **Generative AI** → Learns patterns & structures to produce new data.  

This paradigm enables machines to generate:  
- **Text** (stories, code, poetry)  
- **Images** (artwork, designs)  
- **Audio/Video** (music, clips, animations)  
- **Synthetic data** for simulations and research  

By learning from **vast datasets**, these models develop a **probabilistic internal representation** of data and generate outputs sampled from it.  

✨ **Impact** → Revolutionizes **media, research, healthcare, education, and creativity**.  

### 🖼️ Suggested Image  
- Abstract glowing **neural pathways** converging to form **text, painting, musical note**.  
- Background with **flowing data streams** or grid.

# 📄 Page 2: Generative AI Architectures – The Transformer Model  

### 🎯 Aim  
To explain the foundational architectures of Generative AI, focusing on the **Transformer model**, central to modern LLMs.  

### 📖 Content  
While **GANs** and **VAEs** contributed to Generative AI, the **Transformer (2017, Google Brain)** is the **backbone** of today’s LLMs.  

🔹 **Key Components**  
- **Encoder** → Creates contextual representations of input.  
- **Decoder** → Generates outputs step by step.  

🔹 **Innovations**  
- **Self-Attention** → Captures long-range dependencies.  
- **Positional Encodings** → Preserve token order.  
- **Parallelization** → Trains faster than RNNs.  

📈 This architecture enabled scaling to **billions of parameters**, powering GPT, BERT, LLaMA, etc.
